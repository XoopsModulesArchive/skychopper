This is a generic readme file for all XOOPS modules I make.

All modules install like any other module and are fairly simple
in nature as XOOPs modules go. They don't add any new tables 
to your database nor do they make any other radical changes.

After you install the module you may want to change the name
in the Modules section of your Administrator's Control Panel.

If you have any problems with a module or have a general 
question about them feel free to contact me.
